          Our most ambitious project to date. In 2021 we recruited and trained a
          group of young Scots and embedded them as video journalists at COP 26.
          For the final five nights of COP, they broadcast a 1-hour show
          featuring pre-recorded content, in-studio interviews, a daily round up
          and even recipe ideas. We were partnered and supported by
          ScottishPower, the New York Times, the Redford Center and many more
          organisations and individuals.
