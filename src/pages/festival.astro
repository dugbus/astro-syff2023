  "The Scottish Youth Film Festival is a celebration of the creativity of Scotland’s young filmmakers. Each year, we screen the best films shortlisted from work submitted from across the country and give out awards for best live action, documentary and animation films for age ranges 12 and under and 13-19. Everything is free of charge and there’s workshops, panels and talks with industry professionals, where you can get some hands-on experience of film no matter what your experience level… come along and have a go!";

                First class. Not just a film festival. Two days crammed full of
                lots of young film students taking advantage of high quality
                workshops prior to the awards. Brilliant idea.”
