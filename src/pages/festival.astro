          Our annual festival is a celebration of the creativity of
          Scotland&rsquo;s young filmmakers. Each year, we screen the best films
          shortlisted from work submitted from across the country and give out
          awards for best live action, documentary and animation films for age
          ranges 12 and under and 13-19.
        </p>

        <p>
          The festival is also an opportunity for young people to get hands on
          experience of film making and to find out more about film as a career.
          We host panels, talks, how to sessions, practical animation and film
          making sessions with industry professionals from across the myriad
          jobs in the film and TV industries. Since inception we have had
          actors, directors, stunt people, visual effects technicians, hair and
          make up artists, 3D specialists, sound designers, animators and many
          more.
        </p>

        <p>And all of this is provided free of charge.</p>

        <p>
          This year's Scottish Youth Film Festival will be held on Saturday 30th
          September at North Inch Community Campus in Perth.

                First class. Not just a film festival. Two days crammed full of
                lots of young film students taking advantage of high quality
                workshops prior to the awards. Brilliant idea.”
