      <h1>Improving the life outcomes of young Scots through film</h1>
      <p>
        Learning through film and learning using film allows young people to get
        to grips with the main form of communication in the 21st century. It
        unlocks the literacy of film and moving image allowing young people to
        understand how to interpret a film text. Itâ€™s the ABCs of visual
        storytelling. Learners are encouraged to discuss and interrogate
        different texts, such as adverts, clips, short films and features and to
        go on to produce their own work using this knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of our work in schools and during outreach projects allows this
        interaction. For young people who are interested in taking this further,
        we can offer pathways to further learning and directly to industry. Many
        of the young people we work with go on to pursue creative careers. Our
        work allows young people to safely explore these options with the
        support of SYFF.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are proud to be supported by The Sean Connery Foundation. The Sean
        Connery Foundation grant increases operational capacity, allowing SYFF
        to expand screen education efforts in three areas of focus: film
        education in schools, film outreach projects that reach students in need
        and the execution of their annual youth film festival.
