          Improving the life outcomes of young Scots through film
        </h1>
        <p class="lede">
          Learning through film and learning using film allows young people to
          get to grips with the main form of communication in the 21st century.
          It unlocks the literacy of film and moving image allowing young people
          to understand how to interpret a film text. It&rsquo;s the ABCs of
          visual storytelling. Learners are encouraged to discuss and
          interrogate different texts, such as adverts, clips, short films and
          features and to go on to produce their own work using this knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of our work in schools and during outreach projects allows this
          interaction. For young people who are interested in taking this
          further, we can offer pathways to further learning and directly to
          industry. Many of the young people we work with go on to pursue
          creative careers. Our work allows young people to safely explore these
          options with the support of SYFF.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are proud to be supported by The Sean Connery Foundation. The Sean
          Connery Foundation grant increases operational capacity, allowing SYFF
          to expand screen education efforts in three areas of focus: film
          education in schools, film outreach projects that reach students in
          need and the execution of their annual youth film festival.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “My dad&rsquo;s career in the film industry happened by accident and
            changed the trajectory of his life. Discovering the crafts and
            trades of filmmaking, beyond acting and directing, should not be
            reserved only for the rich, well-connected or lucky ones. And,
            making and discerning screen-based storytelling is nothing short of
            a vital 21st-century skill. It builds creativity, agency and voice,
            project management skills and empathy, to name just a few.
            Supporting SYFF, and screen education more generally, as a focus of
            our foundation is an exciting and natural expression of my
            father&rsquo;s legacy that we hope will help to prepare the young
            Scottish people for the future that lies ahead,”

            <h3>Festival</h3>
            <p>
              Since 2015, we have held an event to celebrate the creativity of
              young Scottish filmmakers. Featuring screenings, workshops, talks
              and panels, this is where anyone can come along and find out about
              the world of film.

            <h3>Outreach</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout the year, we work with youth groups and produce short
              films. Projects target young people who would have difficulty
              accessing film and the film making process.

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
              Working in schools, we teach pupils and teachers how to analyse
              films and how to produce their own work using the tools that they
              have in the classroom.
