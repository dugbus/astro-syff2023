          This is the year when our festival takes place in Perth and (like
          always) we like to get some outreach projects on the go wherever we
          go. These are some Perthshire young folk who have assembled in Crieff
          thanks to our partnership with Strathearn Arts.

          We could only squeeze in a few days here but they were a complete
          blast as the group decided to do a comedy. This hardly ever happens
          because, frankly, comedy is the hardest thing in the world to write
          and just to really ramp up the challenge the team decided to write
          about some of the things that happened during the pandemic. Covid
          comedy!

          We ended up with five sketches in a sort of SNL vein and the space at
          Strathearn arts was turned into a living room, a bar, 10 Downing
          street… you’ll see it at our festival. It was great fun and the team
          were also interviewed by Radio Earn.
