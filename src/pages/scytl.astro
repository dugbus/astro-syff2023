          The Scottish Youth Film Foundation in partnership with The Sean
          Connery Foundation and the National Film and Television School are
          delighted to announce that in Summer 2026 they will be running the
          second year of The Sean Connery Youth Talent Lab.
        </p>

        <p>
          The summer school will take place near Alness in the Highlands from
          21st - 27th June 2026 and will be free to all participants.
        </p>

        <p>
          Designed to mirror and complement the Sean Connery Talent Lab, the
          Youth Talent Lab will take the form of a week-long residential summer
          school where 12 participants will be guided through a compressed
          version of the adult Talent Lab. The team will participate in
          industry-led workshops on story development, scriptwriting, camera,
          acting, editing and on-set skills. Over the course of the week, they
          will create 2 short films (working in 2 groups of 6).
        </p>

        <p>
          SYFF are looking for passionate young Scots, aged 17-22, who are
          interested in directing, writing, acting, camera and editing and want
          to take the next step in their filmmaking journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          We especially encourage applications from young people who are from
          backgrounds currently underrepresented in the film industry.
        </p>
