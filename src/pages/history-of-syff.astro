              With the pandemic came lockdown and our Home film competition

              the theme of home.

              The year COP 26 came to Glasgow and SYFF ran the COP TV project.
              We also opened a film competition called Change and the
              shortlisted films were shown at a special event in the Science
              Centre as part of the Official Cop 26 programme.
