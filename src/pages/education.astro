        <p class="lede">
          We have a long track record of working in schools and in 2019, SYFF
          ran a pilot project in Clackmannanshire to showcase how film in the
          classroom can improve literacy and several other markers in education.
          The project was a huge success and a film and written report are
          available from SYFF upon request.
        </p>

        <p>
          SYFF tutors will work in a classroom setting to teach both the pupils
          and the teachers how film can be effectively used in the classroom.
          Lessons cover film analysis and work towards pupils producing their
          own work using tablets and class resources.
