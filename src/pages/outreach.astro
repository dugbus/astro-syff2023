      <h1>Outreach Projects</h1>

      <p>
        Outreach projects are where we work intensely with a group of young
        people to produce a short film. Each Outreach project is different but
        in general we will visit the group to run an Input day, where we look at
        films, analyse what makes them work and talk about story and script.
        We’ll then give some time for a script to be written and come back to
        work with the group over the course of several days to produce and shoot
        their film. All of the roles are taken by the young people, with SYFF
        tutors on hand to guide the production. Once complete we have a
        celebratory screening in the local community and each outreach film will
        go on to be shown at our Festival.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since inception, we have produced over 20 Outreach films with groups
        from across Scotland and covering, drama and documentary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our outreach work is targeted specifically at young people who would not
        normally get the chance to engage in creative film making activity.

        “My favourite thing has been seeing the young people taking on different
        parts in the film process, from acting, to doing sound, to doing camera
        and seeing how they’ve developed over the week of the shoot.”
