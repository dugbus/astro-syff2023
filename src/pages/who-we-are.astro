      <h2>David Barras</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and brought up in Armadale, West Lothian and have been
        involved in education and media production since 1993. Film was a big
        part of my childhood but it seemed outwith the grasp of anyone coming
        from West Lothian. I’ve now been making and teaching about film for over
        30 years and have been lucky enough to make music videos, documentaries,
        shorts and a feature. Film is a great way to teach important life skills
        and and being able to analyse film is vital for everybody.
      </p>
      <h2>Scott Mackay</h2>
      <p>
        I too grew up in Armadale and always, always, always wanted to tell
        stories. It started with the old school Dungeons and Dragons for my pals
        (including David) and I was hooked on making words come alive ever since
        that time. But no one, not even our parents ever encouraged us to follow
        that as a career. I am also addicted to talking - I'll start a monologue
        for my fellow passengers at a bus stop - and so I even enjoy the
        meetings and all the other things we have to do but they don't compare
        to being with young people and exploring their story, watching it come
        alive in their minds before we even get a camera out.
