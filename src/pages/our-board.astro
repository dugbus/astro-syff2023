              “Over the years, cinema has taught me so much about the world we
              live in. Its ability to enrich and inform our lives is second to
              none. For hundreds of young people in Scotland each year, the
              Scottish Youth Film Foundation is their sole access point for
              learning about, screening and making films. I wish the foundation
              had existed when I was young and I am proud to serve as a board
              member for this unique and hugely impressive organisation”.
